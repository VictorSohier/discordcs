## What is Discord.cs?

Discord.cs is a service based approach to a discord api wrapper

## Why is Discord.cs?

I care to make it because I do not want any of my future discord projects to be dependent upon other people's repositories where in order to add a change, it must be passed by a committee. Also, I kind of want projects to add to my resume and this is a project that a bunch of other projects can branch out of.
